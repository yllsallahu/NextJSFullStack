# Vercel Deployment Instructions

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

1. **MongoDB Connection during Build**: Fixed database connection errors during Vercel builds with improved build-time detection
2. **TailwindCSS v4 compatibility**: Downgraded to v3.4.0 with proper configuration
3. **Dependency issues**: All npm packages synchronized and installed correctly
4. **Build configuration**: Removed conflicting vercel.json, relying on dashboard settings
5. **Vercel Build Environment Detection**: Enhanced detection logic to properly identify build-time vs runtime environment

## üîß Required Environment Variables

You need to add the following environment variables in your Vercel project dashboard:

### Required Variables
- `MONGODB_URI` - Your MongoDB connection string
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - A secret key for NextAuth.js
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your production URL (e.g., https://your-app.vercel.app)

### Optional OAuth Variables (if using Google Auth)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` - Google OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth client secret

## üìã Steps to Complete Deployment

1. **Go to your Vercel Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

2. **Add Environment Variables**
   - Add each variable listed above
   - Make sure to set them for all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

3. **Set Root Directory**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí General
   - Set "Root Directory" to `blog`
   - This tells Vercel where your Next.js app is located in the monorepo

4. **Trigger Redeploy**
   - Go to Deployments
   - Click the 3 dots on the latest deployment
   - Select "Redeploy"

## üöÄ Expected Result

After adding the environment variables and redeploying:
- Build should complete successfully
- All pages should load correctly
- Database-dependent features should work (collections, favorites, auth)

## üîç Monitoring

Monitor the deployment in the Vercel dashboard:
- Check build logs for any remaining errors
- Test the live site functionality
- Verify all routes are accessible

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- The app is configured to gracefully handle missing database connections during build with improved detection logic
- Build-time detection now checks for `VERCEL=1`, `CI=true`, `NEXT_PHASE=phase-production-build`, and other environment indicators
- Static pages will build successfully even without database access
- Dynamic pages will show appropriate fallbacks if database is unavailable
- The improved build detection should resolve the "Database connection not available during build" error on Vercel
